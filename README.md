Ag.Event
=====

TYPO3 Flow package to support domain events as described in the Domain Events chapter from: https://vaughnvernon.co/?page_id=168

# Why?
Because using domain events to communicate information between aggregates, modules and bounded contexts decreases coupling and helps avoiding anemic domain models.

# How?
See Ag.BlogExample for an example on how to integrate.
